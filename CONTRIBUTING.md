# Contribution Guidelines
To get the greatest chance of helpful responses, please follow the below notes:

1. Avoid raising duplicate issues. **Please** use the GitHub issue search feature
   to check whether your bug report or feature request has been mentioned in
   the past at first. Duplicate bug reports and feature requests are a huge maintenance
   burden on the limited resources of the project.
2. When filing bug reports about exceptions or tracebacks, please include the
   *complete* traceback. 
3. Make sure you provide a suitable amount of information to work with. This
   means you should provide:

	- Steps on **how to reproduce the issue**. Ideally, this should be a
     *small* code sample that can be run immediately by the maintainers.
     Failing that, let us know what you're doing, how often it happens, what
     environment you're using, etc.
	- Tell us **what you expected to happen**. When we run your example code,
     what are we expecting to happen? What does "success" look like for your
     code?
	- Tell us **what actually happens**. It's not helpful for you to say "it
     doesn't work" or "it fails". Tell us *how* it fails: do you get an
     exception? A hang? A non-200 status code? How was the actual result
     different from your expected result. 
	
If you do not provide all of these things, it will take us much longer to
   fix your problem. If we ask you to clarify these and you never respond, we
   will close your issue without fixing it.
